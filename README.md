I'm known as Haru or maybe Xiao by some people. You can call me anything you want though. I'm a hobbyist in software development, student, an introvert and the worst procrastinator you can ever meet.

I like messing around with JS, Php, Java, C# and Python. Been developing android applications and web applications since 2016. Just started using C# and Python during the quarantine in 2020.

I'm on
- Discord (XiaoRu#3126)
- Genshin Impact (820593984/AR-48/SEA)
