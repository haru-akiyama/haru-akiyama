I'm known as Haru or maybe Xiao by some people. You can call me anything you want though. I'm a hobbyist in software development, student, an introvert and the worst procrastinator you can ever meet.

Currently working on : 
- A genshin impact based mini-game discord bot
- A chat android application

I like messing around with JS, Php, Java, C# and Python, though I wouldn't say I'm very good at either of them.
