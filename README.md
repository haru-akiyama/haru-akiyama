Hello there, I'm Haru, a hobbyist in software development, student, an introvert and the worst procrastinator you can ever meet.

I like messing around with JS, Php, Java, C# and Python. Been developing android applications and web applications since 2016. Just started using C# and Python during the quarantine in 2020.
